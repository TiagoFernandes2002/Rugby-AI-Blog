    "content": "# Kicking Off: How This Rugby AI Blog Works\n\nWelcome! I’m Tiago, and this is my Rugby AI Blog – a small project I built as part of Asymetric’s technical challenge.\n\nThe idea is simple:\n\n> Let a backend service automatically create rugby articles using real match data (from an external API) and an open-source AI model, then publish them to a minimal but clean frontend.\n\nThis first post is written by me. Every post that comes after this one is generated automatically.\n\n---\n\n## What this blog actually does\n\nThis blog behaves like a normal rugby blog from the outside:\n\n- You see a list of articles on the left.\n- You click one and read the full content on the right.\n- New posts appear over time without any manual work.\n\nUnder the hood, though, it is driven by:\n\n- **Rugby data** from an external API (API-SPORTS Rugby).\n- **An open-source text generation model** hosted on Hugging Face.\n- **A small Node.js backend** that glues everything together and runs scheduled jobs.\n- **A React frontend** that only knows how to call `/articles` and render what it gets.\n\n---\n\n## Tech stack at a glance\n\n**Frontend**\n\n- React + Vite  \n- Axios for HTTP calls  \n- Talks only to: `GET /articles` and `GET /articles/:id`  \n- Configured by `VITE_API_URL` (for example `http://<EC2_IP>:4000`)\n\n**Backend**\n\n- Node.js + Express  \n- Exposes:\n  - `GET /articles`\n  - `GET /articles/:id`\n- Stores articles in a JSON file on disk  \n- Uses:\n  - API-SPORTS Rugby (historic season data) for fixtures and standings\n  - Hugging Face Inference API for text generation\n- Runs scheduled jobs with `node-cron` to create new posts\n\n**Infrastructure**\n\n- Docker for backend and frontend  \n- AWS CodeBuild to build images and push them to ECR  \n- AWS ECR to store the images  \n- One EC2 instance running `docker-compose` to serve the app\n\n---\n\n## How the automatic articles are created\n\nAfter this first manual post, everything else is generated automatically by the backend.\n\nAt a high level, the flow is:\n\n1. **A cron job runs once per day** on the backend container.\n2. It decides what to write:\n   - Sometimes: a *round-up* article based on real rugby fixtures.\n   - Sometimes: a more *opinion / vlog style* article about tactics, trends or league comparisons.\n3. For round-ups, the backend:\n   - Calls the Rugby API with a **historic season** (for example 2022) for several leagues (Top 14, Premiership, URC, etc.).\n   - Filters the matches to a “historical week” window that corresponds to the current week of the year.\n   - Fetches standings to give context on title races and relegation fights.\n   - Builds a structured text summary of results + table situation.\n4. That summary is sent to an AI model hosted on **Hugging Face**.\n   - The prompt asks the model to write as a rugby analyst:\n   - Intro, key matches, league sections, and a short conclusion.\n5. The generated article is saved to `articles.json` on disk through a small repository layer.\n6. The frontend simply calls `/articles` and shows the new content.\n\nFor vlog-style articles, the backend:\n\n- Keeps track of recent topics so it doesn’t repeat itself (for example, not explaining “pendulum defence” every week).  \n- Picks a new theme from a small list (kicking strategy, defensive systems, differences between URC and Top 14, etc.).  \n- Builds a prompt that includes:\n  - The new topic.\n  - A short list of recent titles to avoid duplication.\n- Sends that to the AI model and stores the result as another article.\n\n---\n\n## Why rugby?\n\nRugby is a sport I personally follow and enjoy, so it felt like the right domain for a blog that mixes:\n\n- external APIs,\n- AI text generation,\n- and some basic data-driven analysis.\n\nIt also lets me show that I can:\n\n- work with 3rd-party APIs and their limitations (free tier, historical seasons),\n- design a simple but clean backend API,\n- wire up a frontend in React that is easy to reason about,\n- and deploy the whole thing on AWS using Docker and a small CI pipeline.\n\n---\n\n## How to read this blog\n\nIf you’re reviewing this as part of Asymetric’s process, here’s how I imagine you might explore it:\n\n1. **Start with this post**  \n   – it tells you what the system is doing.\n\n2. **Browse a few automatically generated articles**  \n   – you should see a mix of:\n   - round-up posts about specific “weeks” in historic seasons,\n   - and more general opinion pieces.\n\n3. **Notice that new content appears over time**  \n   – you don’t need to log in anywhere or click “generate”; the backend cron job takes care of it.\n\n4. **If you want more technical detail**  \n   – check the `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` file in the repository for a deeper explanation of the architecture and deployment.\n\n---\n\nThanks for taking the time to read this.  \nFrom here on, the blog belongs mostly to the AI – my job was to wire everything so that it can keep talking about rugby on its own.\n",

    "title": "URC vs Top 14 vs Premiership: different styles of rugby explained",
    "content": "When comparing the Pro14 (now known as URC), the English Premiership, and the French Top 14, fans and analysts alike often notice distinct differences in the way the games are played. These disparities are not merely a result of team dynamics or coaching styles, but rather a reflection of the unique cultures, histories, and trends within each competition.\n\nLet's start by examining the Pro14/URC. This league, featuring teams from Ireland, Wales, Scotland, Italy, and South Africa, is notable for its emphasis on speed and skill-based rugby. Teams like Leinster, Munster, and Ulster, who have consistently dominated the competition, thrive on their ability to execute set pieces and maintain a high tempo throughout the match. Their success is often attributed to the expertise of their backline players, who can create attacking opportunities with ease. The URC's focus on finesse and agility is also a testament to the influence of Southern Hemisphere teams, who have long emphasized the importance of quick passing and aggressive running.\n\nIn contrast, the English Premiership is often characterized by its more direct and physical approach. Teams like Saracens, Leicester, and Exeter have traditionally relied on their forward packs to set the tone for the game, using powerful scrums and lineouts to win possession and create attacking momentum. This style of play is often described as \"set piece rugby,\" with an emphasis on gaining territory and wearing down opponents through relentless pressure. The Premiership's focus on physicality and set piece dominance is also a nod to the league's English and Welsh roots, where the contest is often won in the trenches.\n\nThe French Top 14, meanwhile, is a league that defies easy categorization. On one hand, it features some of the most skilled and dynamic backlines in world rugby, with teams like Toulouse and Clermont showcasing an incredible range of attacking flair. However, the Top 14 is also a league that values physicality and intensity, often to the point of brutality. The likes of Stade Français and Bordeaux-Bègles have consistently punched above their weight, using their powerful forwards to bludgeon opponents into submission. This dichotomy between finesse and ferocity is a hallmark of French rugby, where the game is often played with a mix of technical precision and raw, unbridled passion.\n\nTo illustrate these differences, let's consider a few recent examples. In the 2022 URC final, Leinster and Munster engaged in a thrilling contest that was characterized by its high tempo and technical precision. The two teams combined for over 30 phases of play, with both sides using clever passing and running to create attacking opportunities. In contrast, the 2022 Premiership final between Saracens and Leicester was a more brutal affair, with the two teams engaging in a series of intense set piece battles and physical confrontations. The match featured a staggering 25 penalties and 12 yellow cards, highlighting the Premiership's reputation for intensity and physicality.\n\nOf course, these differences are not absolute, and teams from each league are capable of adapting to different styles of play. However, the unique cultural and historical contexts of each competition have undoubtedly shaped the way the game is played. The URC's emphasis on speed and skill, the Premiership's focus on physicality and set piece dominance, and the Top 14's blend of finesse and ferocity all reflect the distinct identities of each league.\n\nIn conclusion, the URC, Premiership, and Top 14 offer a fascinating glimpse into the diverse range of styles and approaches that exist within professional rugby. While teams from each league are capable of adapting to different situations, their unique cultural contexts and historical traditions have undoubtedly shaped the way the game is played. As fans and analysts, it's essential to recognize and appreciate these differences, rather than simply comparing teams across leagues. By doing so, we can gain a deeper understanding of the complexities and nuances that underlie the beautiful game we love.",

    "title": "United Rugby Championship 2022 – Weekly Round-Up: **URC Round-Up: Exciting Week in Store as Title Contenders Emerge**",
    "content": "The United Rugby Championship is heating up, and this week's results have thrown up a plethora of talking points. As we navigate the winter months, the teams are beginning to show their true colours, and we're starting to get a clearer picture of which sides have what it takes to challenge for the title.\n\nIn the opening match of the week, the Sharks hosted the Ospreys, and it was a dominant display from the South Africans. A 25-10 victory for the Sharks sends a warning sign to the rest of the league: they're not to be underestimated. The Ospreys, however, will be disappointed with their performance, especially after a promising start to the season.\n\nThe other Friday night match saw Munster travel to Scotland to face Edinburgh. It was a resounding victory for the Irish side, with a 38-17 win that showcases their attacking prowess. Munster are certainly looking like title contenders, and their performances so far have been nothing short of impressive. Edinburgh, on the other hand, will need to regroup and refocus if they're to stay in the mix.\n\nThe weekend's schedule got underway on Saturday with a trio of matches. The Stormers hosted the Dragons in what turned out to be a thrilling encounter. A 34-26 victory for the South Africans was a testament to their never-say-die attitude, and they'll take a lot of confidence from this result. The Dragons, meanwhile, will be ruing their inability to close out the game.\n\nZebre welcomed Glasgow Warriors to Parma, and it was a one-way traffic contest. The Scots ran riot, securing a 45-17 victory that cements their position as one of the top teams in the league. Zebre, unfortunately, remain at the foot of the table, and they'll need to pick up the pace if they're to avoid relegation.\n\nConnacht hosted Benetton in the other Saturday match, and it was a real clash of styles. The Irish side's free-flowing rugby ultimately proved too much for their Italian counterparts, with a 38-19 victory that sends a message to the rest of the league. Benetton, however, will be disappointed with their performance, especially after a promising start to the season.\n\nThe final two matches of the weekend saw some impressive displays from the Bulls and Leinster. The South Africans ran in eight tries to secure a 45-9 victory over Cardiff, while Leinster survived a late scare to beat Ulster 38-29. These results further endorse the credentials of these two teams as title contenders.\n\nFinally, the weekend's action wrapped up with a match between the Lions and Scarlets. A 32-15 victory for the Lions ended a four-match losing streak for the team, and it's a much-needed confidence boost. The Scarlets, however, will be disappointed with their performance, especially after a promising start to the season.\n\nAs we look ahead to the next week of action, one thing is certain: the title race is heating up. Munster, Leinster, and the Sharks are all looking like strong contenders, while the likes of Glasgow and the Bulls are also in the mix. But with so many teams still in contention, it's too early to write anyone off. The United Rugby Championship is always a thrilling competition, and this season is shaping up to be no exception.\n\nIn the relegation battle, Zebre and Benetton are currently in the danger zone, but with several teams still to play, it's too early to say who will ultimately drop into the relegation zone. We'll have to wait and see how things unfold, but for now, the focus is on the title contenders.\n\nThe United Rugby Championship is a rollercoaster of a competition, and this week's results have thrown up a plethora of talking points. As we continue to navigate the winter months, we can expect more twists and turns, and we'll be here to bring you all the analysis and insights you need to stay ahead of the game. Stay tuned!"
